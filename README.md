# AshneerBot

AshneerBot is a brutally honest AI mentor designed to challenge weak thinking
and vague startup ideas.

Unlike polite chatbots, this system focuses on pressure, clarity, and direct
feedback — inspired by high-stakes startup pitch environments.

## What it does
- Users submit a startup idea or business thought
- The AI responds with direct, no-nonsense feedback
- It calls out vagueness, weak assumptions, and buzzwords
- The goal is to force clearer thinking, not motivation

## Why I built this
Most AI tools are overly polite and reassuring.
I wanted to explore how **tone and pressure** change decision-making and idea quality.

This project is an experiment in:
- Prompt engineering
- UX psychology
- Human–AI interaction under stress

## Tech stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Serverless API (Vercel)
- AI: OpenAI API
- Hosting: Vercel
- Version control: GitHub

## Design philosophy
- Minimal UI
- Dark theme
- Focus on thinking, not aesthetics
- Fast feedback loop

## Disclaimer
This project is **inspired by high-pressure pitch environments**.
It does not impersonate or clone any real person.
All responses are AI-generated and intended for constructive critique.

## Status
Version 1 — functional MVP  
Planned upgrades:
- Conversation history
- Improved prompt tuning
- Better UI feedback states
